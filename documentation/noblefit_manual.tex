\section{What is \noblefit?}
\noblefit\ is a flexible Matlab/\mbox{GNU Octave} toolbox for quantitative interpretation of (environmental) tracers in terms of environmental processes and models (e.g., dissolved noble gases, other atmospheric gases, or just about anything else that deserves quantitative model-based interpretation).\par

In contrast to similar tools\citep{Aeschbach:1999} where the possible tracers and models are hard-wired into the code, \noblefit\ is designed to allow the user to define his own tracers and models.

\section{Installation and Setup}
This text assumes you are familiar with Matlab or GNU Octave, and that you have a working installation of either Matlab or GNU Octave on your computer.

\subsection{Download \noblefit}\label{sec:get_mpic}
There are two ways to get \noblefit: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The easy method is to download \noblefit\ as a ZIP archive, and expand the files from the archive. You can download the ZIP archive from \url{http://sourceforge.net/p/noblefit/code/HEAD/tarball}.
	\item Alternatively, if you have subversion (SVN) software installed on your computer, you can get \noblefit\ as a SVN repository, which makes upgrading \noblefit\ very easy. You can checkout the SVN repository from \url{http://sourceforge.net/p/noblefit/code/HEAD/tree}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Install \noblefit}\label{sec:install_mpic}
Once you have a copy of \noblefit\ downloaded to your computer, you should move the \noblefit\ folder to a convenient location on your computer. I like to keep all your Matlab/\mbox{GNU Octave} code and packages in one directory, which contains several subdirectories for the different packages and projects. This greatly helps Matlab/\mbox{GNU Octave} to find your files. For instance, I keep all my m-files in {\tt \textasciitilde{}/m-files/}, so \noblefit\ goes to {\tt \textasciitilde{}/m-files/noblefit}. Then I tell Matlab/GNU Octave where to look for the \noblefit\ functions by including the command {\tt addpath('\textasciitilde{}/m-files/noblefit')} in the {\tt startup.m} file (Matlab) or the {\tt .octaverc} file (GNU Octave).

\section{Getting started with \noblefit}
The \noblefit\ tools work the same as any other Matlab/\mbox{GNU Octave} tool. First you need to make sure Matlab or GNU Octave knows where to look for the \noblefit\ files (\secref{install_mpic}). Then you just type the name of the functions to the command shell to execute them.\par

The core of \noblefit\ is the {\tt noblefit.m} function, which fits the data to the model using the $\chi^2$ regression method \citep{Press:1986}. It reports the best-fit values of the fitted model parameters, their errors (calculated by propagation of the data errors), and the some statistics about the goodness of the fit ( $\chi^2$, $p$ value, and degrees of freedom of the regression).\par

Before calling the {\tt noblefit.m} function, however, you need to load and format the data, define the model function, and specify the initial and fixed values of the model parameters. The function the {\tt noblefit.m} facilitats loading and formatting the data, and there are a few predefined model functions in the the {\tt modelfunctions/} folder which you can use as examples. 

Finally, there are a few complete examples of how to use \noblefit\ in the the {\tt examples} folder. While I am working to improve and expand this manual, I'd recommend you take a look at those worked examples to get started.
